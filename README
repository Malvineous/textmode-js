This is a simple HTML5 Canvas utility script that draws onto a canvas as if it
is a CGA text mode display.

Blinking can be turned on or off, and like the hardware, turning off blinking
allows you to use all 16 background colours.

The default font is 9x16 VGA, but others can be substituted easily.

See example-*.html for example use, or these live demos:
